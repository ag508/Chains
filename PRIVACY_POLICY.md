# Chain Messaging - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: January 1, 2024  
**Last Updated**: January 1, 2024

## Introduction

Chain Messaging ("Chain," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have control over your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Chain messaging application and related services (the "Service").

Chain is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. Unlike traditional messaging platforms, Chain uses decentralized blockchain technology and end-to-end encryption to ensure that your communications remain private and secure.

## Our Privacy Principles

1. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy is built into every aspect of Chain's architecture
2. **Data Minimization**: We collect only the minimum data necessary for functionality
3. **User Control**: You maintain complete control over your data and communications
4. **Transparency**: We are open about our data practices and security measures
5. **No Data Mining**: We do not analyze, mine, or monetize your personal communications

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

### We Do Not Sell Your Data
Chain does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for commercial purposes.

### Limited Sharing Scenarios

#### Service Providers
We may share limited information with trusted service providers who help us operate the Service:
- **Cloud infrastructure**: For app distribution and updates (not message storage)

#### Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user information may be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to the same privacy protections.

### Blockchain Network Considerations
Chain uses a decentralized blockchain network for message delivery. While message content is encrypted, some metadata (such as transaction timestamps) may be visible on the blockchain. This metadata cannot be linked to your identity without access to your private keys.
