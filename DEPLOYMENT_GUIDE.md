# Chain Messaging - Comprehensive Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides complete instructions for deploying the Chain Messaging application to production environments. Chain is a decentralized messaging platform that uses blockchain technology and end-to-end encryption to provide secure, censorship-resistant communication.

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 11 or later
- Android SDK 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Gradle 7.0+
- Git

### Required Accounts
- Google Play Console account (for Android deployment)
- Cloud storage accounts for testing (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)
- Firebase account (for crash reporting and analytics)

## Build Configuration

### 1. Environment Setup

#### Local Properties Configuration
Create or update `local.properties` with signing configuration:

```properties
# Signing configuration
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=release.keystore
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=your_key_alias
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password

# Optional: Firebase configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project
```

#### Keystore Generation
Generate a release keystore if you don't have one:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias chain_release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### 2. Build Types

#### Debug Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
- Includes debug symbols
- Enables logging
- Uses debug keystore
- Application ID suffix: `.debug`

#### Staging Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleStaging
```
- Production-like configuration
- Limited logging
- Uses release keystore
- Application ID suffix: `.staging`

#### Release Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
- Fully optimized
- No debug logging
- ProGuard/R8 enabled
- Uses release keystore

./gradlew test

# Lint checks
./gradlew lint

# Security validation
./gradlew runSecurityTests
```

#### Step 3: Build Release
```bash
# Generate APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Generate AAB (recommended for Play Store)
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

#### Step 4: Validate Build
```bash
# Generate deployment report
./gradlew generateDeploymentReport
