# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Chain is a revolutionary decentralized messaging platform that eliminates the need for central servers by leveraging blockchain technology and peer-to-peer communication. The platform provides all the features users expect from modern messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack) while ensuring complete privacy, censorship resistance, and user data ownership. The system uses participants' devices as nodes in a lightweight blockchain network, with messages transmitted securely through end-to-end encryption using the Signal Protocol.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Identity Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using familiar methods without phone numbers, so that I can access the platform globally while maintaining privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL provide authentication options including Google/Microsoft accounts, passkeys, and biometric authentication
2. WHEN a user selects an authentication method THEN the system SHALL generate a unique user identity without requiring phone number verification
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create cryptographic key pairs for the user's blockchain identity
4. IF a user has existing credentials THEN the system SHALL allow seamless login across devices
5. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL initialize their Signal Protocol identity keys for end-to-end encryption

### Requirement 2: Decentralized Messaging Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a user, I want my messages to be transmitted through a decentralized network, so that my communication cannot be censored or controlled by any central authority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL connect to the Chain blockchain network as a participating node
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using Signal Protocol and broadcast it as a blockchain transaction
3. WHEN a message transaction is created THEN the system SHALL process it within 10-30 second block intervals
4. WHEN messages are delivered THEN the system SHALL automatically prune them from the blockchain after 48 hours
5. IF the blockchain network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages locally and retry transmission
6. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize all pending messages

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Encryption and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my messages to be end-to-end encrypted, so that only the intended recipients can read my communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL establish Signal Protocol encryption keys with the recipient
2. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL encrypt it locally before blockchain transmission
3. WHEN a message is received THEN the system SHALL decrypt it only on the recipient's device
4. WHEN encryption keys are generated THEN the system SHALL store them securely using device keystore/secure enclave
5. IF key exchange fails THEN the system SHALL display a security warning and prevent message transmission
6. WHEN a user verifies another user THEN the system SHALL provide safety number verification

### Requirement 4: Real-time Messaging Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive messaging features similar to WhatsApp, so that I can communicate effectively with individuals and groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL support text, emoji, and rich formatting

3. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL show delivery status (sending, sent, delivered, read)
4. WHEN a user receives a message THEN the system SHALL display real-time notifications
5. WHEN users are in a conversation THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators and online status
6. WHEN a user wants to reply THEN the system SHALL support message replies and forwarding
7. WHEN a user reacts to a message THEN the system SHALL support emoji reactions

### Requirement 5: Group Chat Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage group chats with up to 100,000 members, so that I can communicate with large communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a group THEN the system SHALL support up to 100,000 participants
2. WHEN a group is created THEN the system SHALL establish group encryption keys for all members
3. WHEN a user joins a group THEN the system SHALL provide them with message history access
4. WHEN group settings are changed THEN the system SHALL support admin controls for member management
5. WHEN a member leaves THEN the system SHALL update group encryption keys for forward secrecy
6. WHEN group messages are sent THEN the system SHALL efficiently distribute them to all members

### Requirement 6: Voice and Video Calling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to make voice and video calls through the decentralized network, so that I can have real-time conversations without relying on centralized services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a call THEN the system SHALL establish WebRTC peer-to-peer connection
2. WHEN call signaling is needed THEN the system SHALL use the blockchain for connection establishment
3. WHEN a call is active THEN the system SHALL support voice-only and video calling modes
4. WHEN call quality is poor THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality based on network conditions
5. IF direct connection fails THEN the system SHALL use TURN servers for relay
6. WHEN a call ends THEN the system SHALL clean up all connection resources

### Requirement 7: Cloud Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use my existing cloud storage for media sharing, so that I can share files without the platform storing them centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user shares media THEN the system SHALL support Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, and Dropbox integration
2. WHEN media is uploaded THEN the system SHALL encrypt files before storing them in user's cloud storage
3. WHEN media is shared THEN the system SHALL send encrypted access links through messages
4. WHEN recipients access media THEN the system SHALL decrypt files locally after download
5. IF cloud storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide local caching as fallback
6. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify users and suggest cleanup

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use Chain on all my devices, so that I can stay connected regardless of platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria
