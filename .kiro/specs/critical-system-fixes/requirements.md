# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chain messaging application has been implemented with comprehensive features including blockchain integration, Signal Protocol encryption, WebRTC calling, and cloud storage. However, critical system-level issues prevent successful compilation and proper integration between components. This specification addresses the essential fixes needed to resolve model definitions, interface synchronization, dependency injection, and type system conflicts that are blocking the application from building and running correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Signal Protocol Integration Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Signal Protocol encryption system to compile and integrate properly, so that the application can build successfully and provide secure messaging functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Signal Protocol classes are imported THEN the system SHALL resolve all library type references including SenderKeyName, EncryptedGroupMessage, and SenderKeyRecord
2. WHEN internal store classes are used THEN the system SHALL avoid naming conflicts with Signal library classes through proper aliasing or renaming
3. WHEN GroupEncryptionManager methods are called THEN the system SHALL access createSession, encryptGroupMessage, and decryptGroupMessage functions from properly injected dependencies
4. WHEN Signal Protocol dependencies are injected THEN the system SHALL conform to the required org.signal.libsignal.protocol interfaces
5. IF type mismatches occur between internal and library classes THEN the system SHALL use proper type aliases or interface implementations to resolve conflicts

### Requirement 2: Model Definition Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all model definitions to be unique and properly structured, so that there are no compilation errors from duplicate declarations or conflicting types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model classes are defined THEN the system SHALL have only one definitive source for each model (IdentityStorage, CryptoException, SessionStorage)
2. WHEN security models are accessed THEN the system SHALL use consistent types from a single package (preferably domain.model for UI-consumed models)
3. WHEN presentation layer ViewModels access models THEN the system SHALL use the same model types returned by Core Layer Manager methods
4. WHEN duplicate files exist THEN the system SHALL delete all but one authoritative version and update all imports accordingly
5. IF model redeclarations are detected THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, well-defined structure

### Requirement 3: Security Alert and Enum System Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the security alert system to have properly defined enums and accessible properties, so that security monitoring and identity verification features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SecurityAlert enums are referenced THEN the system SHALL provide access to IdentityKeyChanged, KeyMismatch, SuspiciousActivity, and PolicyViolation values
2. WHEN SecurityLevel enums are used THEN the system SHALL define HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW values in the appropriate enum class
3. WHEN SecurityRecommendation types are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide VerifyContacts, ReviewSecurityAlerts, UpdateKeys, and EnableTwoFactor options
4. WHEN security model properties are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide displayName, activityType, and details fields
5. IF security enums are undefined THEN the system SHALL create them as sealed classes or enums in the definitive security model source

### Requirement 4: Date and Time Conversion Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent date/time handling throughout the application, so that timestamp conversions work properly between different time representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Date objects need Long conversion THEN the system SHALL use .time property on java.util.Date instances
2. WHEN LocalDateTime needs Long conversion THEN the system SHALL use .toEpochSecond(ZoneOffset.UTC) method
3. WHEN timestamp fields are accessed THEN the system SHALL handle both Date and Long types consistently
4. WHEN database entities store timestamps THEN the system SHALL use Long values for consistency with local database requirements
5. IF time conversion errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide proper conversion utilities between Date, LocalDateTime, and Long types

### Requirement 5: Dependency Injection Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependency injection to work correctly, so that services and managers receive their required dependencies and the application can initialize properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DI modules are processed THEN the system SHALL provide all required dependencies for each service and manager
2. WHEN repositories are injected THEN the system SHALL have access to properly implemented DAO interfaces
3. WHEN ViewModels are created THEN the system SHALL receive all required use cases and managers through constructor injection
4. WHEN services require context THEN the system SHALL provide Android Context where needed (especially for WebRTC components)
5. IF missing dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL add the required @Provides methods or constructor parameters

### Requirement 6: Type System and Smart Cast Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kotlin type system issues resolved, so that smart casts work properly and type mismatches are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex expressions need smart casting THEN the system SHALL use local variables to enable smart cast analysis
2. WHEN StateFlow values are accessed THEN the system SHALL use .value property instead of .currentState
3. WHEN collection type conversions are needed THEN the system SHALL properly convert between Set and List types
4. WHEN nullable types are checked THEN the system SHALL structure code to allow Kotlin smart cast inference
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL add explicit type conversions or restructure code for type safety

### Requirement 7: UI Component Integration Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI components to compile and display correctly, so that the user interface works without runtime errors or missing resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Compose components are used THEN the system SHALL provide all required parameters for each component
2. WHEN icon resources are referenced THEN the system SHALL have all required icons available or use appropriate alternatives
3. WHEN UI state is accessed THEN the system SHALL use proper state management patterns with StateFlow and Compose state
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL have consistent Screen definitions without conflicts
5. IF UI compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL fix parameter mismatches and resource references

### Requirement 8: Build System and Compilation Success

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire application to compile successfully, so that I can build, test, and deploy the Chain messaging application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without any unresolved reference errors
2. WHEN dependencies are resolved THEN the system SHALL have all required libraries and their correct versions
3. WHEN code analysis runs THEN the system SHALL pass all type checking and syntax validation
4. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL produce a working APK that can be installed and launched
5. IF build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution paths for remaining issues
